# DAT355_Third_Assignment_Epsilon

Exercises
----------

1.1)<br>
Bowling ECore model from Assignment1 (Model-to-text, out-place, heterogenous, declarative)<br>
Translate a UML diagram to Entity classes (Model-to-text, out-place, heterogeneous, declarative)

1.2)<br>
Yes, the components of a compiler perform model transformations.<br>
The compiler takes a program, parses it into a tree like structure based on the syntax of the language,<br>
and tests if the code is valid in accordance with the grammar of the language.<br>
The compiler would then attempt to transform the created syntax model, to create more efficient versions of the code,<br>
optimized for the machine to read and execute.<br>
Each step along the process takes the resulting model from the previous step to perform the next step.<br>
Creating a series of model transformations from the written code, to the binary data read and executed by the machine.

2)<br>
Files are located in Exercise1 project folder (./model-ws/Exercise1/)

3.1)<br>
ETL file is exe.etl in (model-ws/Exercise3/exe.etl)<br>
and the output .relational file is in (model-ws/Exercise3/output/MyRelationalModel.relational).

It seems it is not possible to specify Column data type as NUMBER,<br>
as ETL cant find the enum for some reason?<br>
Error: Cannot find enumeration literal SQLDataType#NUMBER in model IN<br>



3.2)<br>
Still unable to specify Column data type as NUMBER, due to cant find the enum.<br>

Starting to think I might be doing something wrong,<br>
as the model seems to build on its own components as input?<br>
Could be the reason behind equivalent() errors.




3.3)<br>
To be done.<br>
Work in progress...
